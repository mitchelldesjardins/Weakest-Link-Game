     <h1>THE RULES</h1>
  <div align= "left" width="50">
    <ul>
      <li>The game is broken up into three rounds.</li><br>
      <li>Use the first two rounds to accumulate money (you cannot lose here).</li><br>
      <li>The last round is a sudden death round that will determine if you will walk away with the total money you have earned or label <b>YOU</b> as the “WEAKEST LINK”</li>
    </ul>
      <p><b>Note:</b> the objective of rounds 1 and 2 are to create a chain of consecutive correct answers to climb the “Money Tree” to gain money for your "bank" within a specific time limit. <br> An incorrect answer throws you to the bottom of the "money tree" and you lose all the money accumulated up to that point. However, <b>YOU</b> the player can say "bank", (press the bank button) prior to a question being asked, then the accumulated money is stored, and the “Money Tree” resets to zero.<br>
      You have 4 possible answer choices, there is only one correct answer for each question.
